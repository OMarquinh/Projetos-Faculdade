# Projetos Faculdade


### Explanation <h3>
Here I will leave all the projects I developed in college, even though they are basic things, I want to leave them for easy access when I need some of them regardless of use and to show the way I put together my codes in addition to my logic.

Here you will have files of the languages ​​I learned: Python, Java and C.
But some of them have more things than others and will always be updated as I do more college activities and anything I develop at home.

##### Note: For now some of the codes have no explanation and I will do this over time, the only thing that can help you understand better what it does is the name of the file and its use <h5>
